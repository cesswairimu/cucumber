Feature: Feedback when entering invalid credit card details
    In user testing we've seen a lot of people who made mistakes
    entering their credit card. We need to be as helpful as possible
    here to avoid losing users at this crucial stage of the
    transaction.
    Background:
        Given I have chosen some items to buy
        And I am about to enter my credit card details
    Scenario: Credit card number too short
        When I enter a card number that's only 15 digits long
        And all the other details are correct
        And I submit the form
        Then the form should be redisplayed
        And I should see a message advising me of the correct number of digits
    Scenario: Expiry date invalid
        When I enter a card expiry date that's in the past
        And all the other details are correct
        And I submit the form
        Then the form should be redisplayed
        And I should see a message telling me the expiry date must be wrong

    Scenario: Attempt withdrawal using stolen card
        Given I have $100 in my account
        But my card is invalid
        When I request $50
        Then my card should not be returned
        And I should be told to contact the bank
